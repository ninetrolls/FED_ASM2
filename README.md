# FED_ASM2
This repository is for Meng Zhi and Hai Wen's FED Assignment 2. This project is basically a ecommerce website that allows the user to browse through the products sold on the website. The website allows the user to claim vouchers and allow the users to add products to cart. The users are then able to edit the wuantity of the products they have in their cart and will be able to see the total price of the products in their cart get tallied up. The user would be able to sign up and log into the website. 

# Design Process
We have used the websites of other ecommerce websites as our inspiration to our website aethetics and layout. This website is mostly aimed towards millenials and teenagers, as such, we have decided to go with the main colors black and white in order to appeal to our target audience. We ensured that the website would not seem cluttered and is very minimalistic. We think that this would appeal to our target audience and allow them to be more attracted to using our website. 

The users would be using our website for commercial purposes. As such, the website would need to allow the users to easily access the products they want to purchase. With the layout of our website, it ensures that our products are evenly spaced out, to prevent overcrowding of the displayed products. When the user adds a product to cart, it will be automatically added to the cart page where all other products added by the user will be displayed with the total price tallied and displayed at the bottom. This allows the user to have a good user experience as they are able to easily access their products through the home page and their cart. 

The cart page is equipped with functions that allows the users to easily edit the products in their cart and will tally up the total price of the items in the cart. This further improves the experience the users will have when using our website. 

User Stories: 
1) As a user that is in their teens, I want to be able to easily browse through the products on any ecommerce page and be able to easily filter out products that I will be more interested in. I

Your Project's Name
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
